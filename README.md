### CONCEPT
Given the proper real-world data and trained with deep reinforcement learning, intelligent agents might simulate behaviors corresponding to those of people in Harlem neighborhood. Such a simulation could serve as a platform for decision-making and strategy analysis.

Which urban block would be a good spot for commercial activities? Will the design of a new building influence peopleâ€™s behaviors of the area? As my attempt to see what abilities the machine learning holds to answer above questions, this is a demonstration that shows some behaviors could be potentially achieved.
